                <h2>Abount The Founder</h2>
                <p>Praveen Kumar L, also known as Rider Praveen, is a remarkable individual whose compassion knows 
                    no bounds. Once a dedicated gym instructor, he made the selfless decision to leave behind his career 
                    to pursue a calling far greater than himself: the welfare and rescue of animals in need. This noble 
                    pursuit led him to establish the We Save Animals (WSA) Welfare Trust, a sanctuary of hope 
                    for countless animals who have been abandoned, injured, or otherwise left to fend for themselves.</p>

                <p>Praveen's shelter serves as a haven for animals facing some of life's toughest challenges. 
                    His care extends to a diverse group of residents, including paralysed animals, those who are blind, 
                    elderly creatures in their twilight years, and victims of accidents or cruelty. He also embraces 
                    terminally ill animals, ensuring their remaining days are filled with love, dignity, and comfort. 
                    For each of these beings, the shelter is not just a place 
                    of refuge; it is a place where they can find happiness, nutritious food, and a sense of belonging.</p>

                <p>Through his unwavering commitment, Praveen has transformed what could have been a life of 
                    despair for these animals into a life of hope and joy. His story is an inspiring testament to 
                    the power of empathy, showcasing how one personâ€™s determination can create ripples of change for 
                    the voiceless and vulnerable. The WSA Welfare Trust is not just an animal shelter; it is a beacon 
                    of kindness, 
                    built on the foundation of Praveen's extraordinary sacrifice and love for animals.</p>
