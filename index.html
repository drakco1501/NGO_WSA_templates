                <h2>We Save Animals</h2>
                <p>At We Save Animals (WSA) Welfare Trust, compassion and care come first. Founded by Rider Praveen Kumar,
                     an ex-gym instructor who chose a path of selflessness, our trust is dedicated to rescuing and 
                     rehabilitating animals in need. From abandoned pets to injured strays and those suffering from old age, 
                     blindness, or terminal illnesses, we provide them with a sanctuary where they can live
                     with dignity, love, and comfort. Our mission is to ensure that no animal is left unloved or uncared for.</p>

                <h2>A Safe Haven for Every Animal</h2>
                <p>Our shelter is more than just a refuge—it's a second chance at life. We specialize in 
                    catering to animals facing challenges such as paralysis, accidents, or abuse, offering 
                    them specialized medical care and emotional healing. With a team of passionate 
                    volunteers and caregivers, we ensure each animal receives personalized attention and 
                    a forever home in our shelter. WSA Welfare Trust is a testament to the belief that 
                    kindness can transform lives, not only for animals but for the people who get to 
                    witness their recovery and joy.</p>
